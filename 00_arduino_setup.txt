Board: Makerduino UNO v3.0 with 
Processor: Atmel Mega 328P
From: makerstudio

Display: 16x2 LCD Display
	=> The code is adjusted to these limitations.

I used in addition an Electronic Brick Shield v1.1 (also from makerstudio) since it had easy to use pins for the I2C LCD connection.

Two push buttons, connected to digital pins 3 and 4

ATTENTION: DON'T CONNECT ANALOG PIN 0. 
	=> It needs to be "free" to be able to "produce randomness"
